                Above is a table with just some of the metadata that can be collected from you, purely by visiting a website. But what really is metadata?
                Well metadata is a type of data that provides information about other data! It can be the timestamp of a message, location taken of an image,
                or even the cookies that get sent on a website. But why is metadata important to hackers and how can it be used? Surely the information that
                was extracted from you in the table is harmless?
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Is our metadata really harmless?</h2>
            <h3>Browser and Operating System</h3>
            <p>
                Well yes and no. For instance, take the first two entries which are your browser and operating system. While this may also seem like quite
                harmless knowledge, this allows hackers to take advantage of known security flaws in such systems once they know exactly what you're using.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Language and Timezone</h3>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the language and even the timezone location fields despite looking possibly scary are fairly harmless!
                While your language and timezone location can help hackers craft more convincing phishing schemes, on their own they won't be able
                to do much. Hackers are normally after digital information to be able to impersonate you online, so despite them knowing your country or city
                might seem scary, there's not much to act on there.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Referrer</h3>
            <p>
                The referrer is a fairly interesting piece of metadata that tells the website exactly what other website you came from. Importantly, this
                only works if you are loading a https website from a https website or a http website from a http website. For security reasons, modern
                browsers will block referrer information if you load between http and https websites! Using referrers, hackers can discover exactly
                what website you most recently visited which they can use to track or potentially steal your information.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are incredibly important to security and privacy as they reveal everything about your activities on a website. Any sort of interaction
                you may perform is generally recorded as a cookie. While a cookie can only be read by the website that created it for that very reason,
                hackers can still obtain them via XSS attacks, network sniffing or even social engineering! Imagine someone else knowing every single post you
                liked and every interaction you have ever had on a website. Not only can they now target their efforts more efficiently, but if they gain access
                to your session cookies they have access to your entire account on that website. That can be quite catastrophic especially if it was your bank
                account! You can check all the cookies a website has on you via inspect element and going to the "Storage" section.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Public IP Addresses</h3>
            <p>
                While none of the IP addresses that were fetched using this website are particularly harmful, they still pose a potential threat. Your public
                IP address stores basic geolocation data and can even be tracked down to the ISP you use. Furthermore, despite this IP address being "public"
                it is not common knowledge and a website needs to manually extract it to receive it. Using this IP address, hackers can even make a DDOS attack
                on you! While this is potentially dangerous, the risk is incredibly low as there are many protections against this nowadays.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>How can we stay safe?</h2>
            <p>
                While it's impossible to hide all metadata associated to you, there are a number of ways you can minimise how much others know about you.
                A few ways to do this is to use a VPN, accept the least number of cookies you can, and erase any metadata from a file before you upload it.
                All our files such as photos taken from our phone include metadata such as the location these photos were taken in. Whenever you upload a photo,
                try to strip all its metadata first, as uploading it carelessly can give people a lot of information about you! Not all websites like OpenLearning
                do this automatically.
